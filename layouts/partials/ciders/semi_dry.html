This blend of Old World bittersweets and New World culinary apples mirrors our studious respect for tradition and the crafty ingenuity we employ to bring you this very balance of the orchard in a can. Not too sweet, and made from nothing but apples, Moontowerâ€™s Semi-Dry Cider is a modern ode to our own heritage.
