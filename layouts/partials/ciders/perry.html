Ours is a modern American perry made in the new tradition with a blend of culinary fruit and fermented cleanly with neutral champagne yeast to let the fruit through unobscured.  The result delivers a delightfully rounded balance of softer acids with a body fuller than its apple-derived cousins and a surprising aromatic resemblance to the fruit itself.
